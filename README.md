## Information
The code is split in two python notebooks, one called models (for the training of the potential models) and another called CAM (for the Class Activation Map). 

The dataset used can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1293X4rGFOenkJGJc6DaYGK4LjIoYfwDf/view?usp=sharing). Alternatively, the original dataset (without our extra photos) can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification). To use the notebooks you will need the database in .zip format. 

In the results folder you will find the weights of the models we trained in .ckpt format, and the plots of their losses.
